# Weave Touch for iPad
### My experimental playground for messing with Swift and SwiftUI on iOS, initially kickstarted by ChatGPT.

## Features:

95% of the Weave experience on desktop

Pull-to-refresh and pinch to zoom gesture support

No sideloading required to run on iPad!

Clean design

Very lightweight and efficient

Sometimes gets new features before Weave for Mac

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an iPad running iPadOS 16.0 or newer with Swift Playground 4.0 or newer installed to run directly, can also be compiled as an IPA to run on any iOS 16+ device (untested) or run on a Mac with macOS Ventura or newer with Swift Playgrounds or Xcode in Mac Catalyst.

Built with Swift Playgrounds 4, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (mostly) with ChatGPT.

Current app icon designer: Me

## What's next?

Fixed script injection

An iPhone-friendly UI

Built in function to export as an IPA

## Features Weave Touch is missing compared to Weave:

Toolbar customization (haven't figured out why)

Sharing support (technical reasons, Swift Playgrounds crashes when I try using the Share Sheet)

CSS and JavaScript injection (for now, this is one update away, though)

Actually commented code lmao

"Download Page" button (I simply don't need it at this time and implementing it would be difficult compared to on the Mac)
