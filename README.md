# Weave Touch for iPad and iPhone
### My experimental playground for messing with Swift and SwiftUI on iOS, initially kickstarted by ChatGPT.

## Features:

95% of the Weave experience on desktop

Pull-to-refresh and pinch to zoom gesture support

No sideloading required to run on iPad (via Swift Playgrounds)!

Clean design

Very lightweight and efficient

Sometimes gets new features before Weave for Mac

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an iPad running iPadOS 16.0 or later with Swift Playground 4.0 or newer installed to run directly, or a Mac with macOS Ventura or newer with Swift Playgrounds or Xcode in Mac Catalyst/iPad compatibility mode, or an iPhone running iOS 16.0 or later with a Mac to deploy the application to.

Built with Swift Playgrounds 4, Xcode, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (mostly) with ChatGPT.

Current app icon designer: Me

## What's next?

Fixed script injection

Swipe gestures for back/forward controls

IPA builds of the application

Proper versioning scheme and bundle identifier

iPhone support and better Split View/SlideOver support (*wink wink*)

## Features Weave Touch is missing compared to Weave:

Toolbar customization (haven't figured out why)

Sharing support (technical reasons, Swift Playgrounds crashes when I try using the Share Sheet)

CSS and JavaScript injection (for now, this is one update away, though)

Actually commented code lmao

"Download Page" button (I simply don't need it at this time and implementing it would be difficult compared to on the Mac)
