# Weave Touch for iPad
### My experimental playground for messing with Swift and SwiftUI on iOS, initially kickstarted by ChatGPT.

*This design is a work in progress and may be modified before release.*

## Features:

95% of the Weave experience on desktop

Pull-to-refresh and pinch to zoom gesture support

No sideloading required to run on iPad!

Clean design

Very lightweight and efficient

Sometimes gets new features before Weave for Mac

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an iPad running iPadOS 16.0 or newer with Swift Playground 4.0 or newer installed to run directly, can also be compiled as an IPA to run on any iOS 16+ device (untested) or run on a Mac with macOS Ventura or newer with Swift Playgrounds or Xcode in Mac Catalyst.

Built with Swift Playgrounds 4, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (mostly) with ChatGPT.

Current app icon designer: Me

## What's next?

Complete toolbar redesign with support for customizations

Built in function to export as an IPA

Share Sheet support
